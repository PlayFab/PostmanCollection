The api-body accepts the following case-sensitive parameters:**\n\n\"AccessPolicy\": The policy indicating who is allowed to join the lobby, and the visibility to queries. May be 'Public', 'Friends' or 'Private'. Public means the lobby is both visible in queries and any player may join, including invited players. Friends means that users who are bidirectional friends of members in the lobby may search to find friend lobbies, to retrieve its connection string. Private means the lobby is not visible in queries, and a player must receive an invitation to join. Defaults to 'Public' on creation. Can only be changed by the lobby owner.\n\n\"CustomTags\": The optional custom tags associated with the request (e.g. build number, external trace identifiers, etc.).\n\n\"LobbyData\": The private key-value pairs which are only visible to members of the lobby. At most 30 key-value pairs may be stored here, keys are limited to 30 characters and values to 1000. The total size of all lobbyData values may not exceed 4096 bytes. Keys are case sensitive.\n\n\"MaxPlayers\": The maximum number of players allowed in the lobby. The value must be between 2 and 128.\n\n\"Members\": The member initially added to the lobby. Client must specify exactly one member, which is the creator's entity and member data. Member PubSubConnectionHandle must be null or empty. Game servers must not specify any members.\n\n\"Owner\": The lobby owner. Must be the calling entity.\n\n\"OwnerMigrationPolicy\": The policy for how a new owner is chosen. May be 'Automatic', 'Manual' or 'None'. Can only be specified by clients. If client-owned and 'Automatic' - The Lobby service will automatically assign another connected owner when the current owner leaves or disconnects. The useConnections property must be true. If client - owned and 'Manual' - Ownership is protected as long as the current owner is connected. If the current owner leaves or disconnects any member may set themselves as the current owner. The useConnections property must be true. If client-owned and 'None' - Any member can set ownership. The useConnections property can be either true or false.\n\n\"SearchData\": The public key-value pairs which allow queries to differentiate between lobbies. Queries will refer to these key-value pairs in their filter and order by clauses to retrieve lobbies fitting the specified criteria. At most 30 key-value pairs may be stored here. Keys are of the format string_key1, string_key2 ... string_key30 for string values, or number_key1, number_key2, ... number_key30 for numeric values.Numeric values are floats. Values can be at most 256 characters long. The total size of all searchData values may not exceed 1024 bytes.\n\n\"UseConnections\": A setting to control whether connections are used. Defaults to true. When true, notifications are sent to subscribed players, disconnect detection removes connectionHandles, only owner migration policies using connections are allowed, and lobbies must have at least one connected member to be searchable or be a server hosted lobby with a connected server. If false, then notifications are not sent, connections are not allowed, and lobbies do not need connections to be searchable.\n\nTo set up an Environment, click the text next to the eye icon up top in Postman (it should say \"No environment\", if this is your first time using Postman).

Friends means that users who are bidirectional friends of members in the lobby may search to find friend lobbies, to retrieve its connection string. Private means the lobby is not visible in queries, and a player must receive an invitation to join. Defaults to 'Public' on creation. Can only be changed by the lobby owner.\n\n\"ArrangementString\": A field which indicates which lobby the user will be joining. This field is opaque to everyone except the Lobby service and the creator of the arrangementString (Matchmaking). This string defines a unique identifier for the arranged lobby as well as the title and member the string is valid for. Arrangement strings have an expiration.\n\n\"CustomTags\": The optional custom tags associated with the request (e.g. build number, external trace identifiers, etc.).\n\n\"MaxPlayers\": The maximum number of players allowed in the lobby. The value must be between 2 and 128.\n\n\"MemberData\": The private key-value pairs used by the member to communicate information to other members and the owner. Visible to all members of the lobby. At most 30 key-value pairs may be stored here, keys are limited to 30 characters and values to 1000. The total size of all memberData values may not exceed 4096 bytes. Keys are case sensitive.\n\n\"MemberEntity\": The member entity who is joining the lobby. The first member to join will be the lobby owner.\n\n\"OwnerMigrationPolicy\": The policy for how a new owner is chosen. May be 'Automatic', 'Manual' or 'None'. Can only be specified by clients. If client-owned and 'Automatic' - The Lobby service will automatically assign another connected owner when the current owner leaves or disconnects. The useConnections property must be true. If client - owned and 'Manual' - Ownership is protected as long as the current owner is connected. If the current owner leaves or disconnects any member may set themselves as the current owner. The useConnections property must be true. If client-owned and 'None' - Any member can set ownership. The useConnections property can be either true or false.\n\n\"UseConnections\": A setting to control whether connections are used. Defaults to true. When true, notifications are sent to subscribed players, disconnect detection removes connectionHandles, only owner migration policies using connections are allowed, and lobbies must have at least one connected member to be searchable or be a server hosted lobby with a connected server. If false, then notifications are not sent, connections are not allowed, and lobbies do not need connections to be searchable.\n\nTo set up an Environment, click the text next to the eye icon up top in Postman (it should say \"No environment\", if this is your first time using Postman). Select \"Manage environments\", then \"Add\".

May be 'Public', 'Friends' or 'Private'. Public means the lobby is both visible in queries and any player may join, including invited players. Friends means that users who are bidirectional friends of members in the lobby may search to find friend lobbies, to retrieve its connection string. Private means the lobby is not visible in queries, and a player must receive an invitation to join. Defaults to 'Public' on creation. Can only be changed by the lobby owner.\n\n\"CustomTags\": The optional custom tags associated with the request (e.g. build number, external trace identifiers, etc.).\n\n\"LobbyData\": The private key-value pairs which are only visible to members of the lobby. Optional. Sets or updates key-value pairs on the lobby. Only the current lobby owner can set lobby data. Keys may be an arbitrary string of at most 30 characters.

Optional. Deletes key-value pairs on the caller's member data. All the specified keys will be removed from the caller's member data. Keys that do not exist are a no-op. If the key to delete exists in the memberData (same request) it will result in a bad request. Servers cannot specifiy this.\n\n\"MemberEntity\": The member entity whose data is being modified. Servers cannot specify this.\n\n\"MembershipLock\": A setting indicating whether the lobby is locked. May be 'Unlocked' or 'Locked'. When Locked new members are not allowed to join.
