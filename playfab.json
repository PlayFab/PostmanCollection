This API creates a snapshot of all player profiles that match the segment definition at the time of its creation and lives through the Total Seconds to Live, refreshing its life span on each subsequent use of the Continuation Token. Profiles that change during the course of paging will not be reflected in the results. AB Test segments are currently not supported by this operation.\n\nApi Documentation: https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/Server/method/GetPlayersInSegment\n\n**The following case-sensitive environment variables are required for this call:**\n\n\"TitleId\" - The Title Id of your game, available in the Game Manager (https://developer.playfab.com)\n\n\"SecretKey\" - The PlayFab API Secret Key, available in the dashboard of your title (https://developer.playfab.com/title/properties/{{titleId}})\n\n**The body of this api-call should be proper json-format.  The api-body accepts the following case-sensitive parameters:**\n\n\"SegmentId\": Unique identifier for this segment.\n\n\"SecondsToLive\": Number of seconds to keep the continuation token active. After token expiration it is not possible to continue paging results. Default is 300 (5 minutes). Maximum is 1,800 (30 minutes).\n\n\"MaxBatchSize\": Maximum number of profiles to load. Default is 1,000. Maximum is 10,000.\n\n\"ContinuationToken\": Continuation token if retrieving subsequent pages of results.\n\nTo set up an Environment, click the text next to the eye icon up top in Postman (it should say \"No environment\", if this is your first time using Postman). Select \"Manage environments\", then \"Add\". Type a name for your environment where it says \"New environment\", then enter each variable name above as the \"Key\", with the value as defined for each above.",
